    <p class="para"> My name is Alexis Tura, I live in Mahayahay 1, Pasil, Cebu City,<br>
        and I am currently studying <strong> Information Technology at the University of Cebu</strong>.<br>
         I chose this course because I am interested in learning more about computers,<br>
          technology, and how they can be used to solve real-life problems.
         Aside from studying, I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends,<br> which keeps me motivated and inspired.
          I believe that through hard work and determination,<br>
           I can achieve my dreams and build a better future for myself and the people around me.<br>
          I am a also reliable individual who takes pride in meeting deadlines,<br> keeping promises, and staying true in my responsibilities,
         I work independently or as part of a team,<br>and maintain a strong sense of accountability in everything I do.</p></div>
